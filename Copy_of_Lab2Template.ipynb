It is much easier to compare the difference per year in the average win points. For example, in 1984 the graph shows a negative deviation in win points compared to 1986. Each year will show only a positive or negative deviation; never both. "

As you can tell from the graph, each year the total points for both lose and win points are around the similar total. You can infer from this that most of the games between the two teams in the NCAA were close ones. From 1984-1986 the total points increase, then from 1987-1999 the total points decrease. From 2001-2017 the total points remain relatively the same. Overall you can tell that the correlation between win/lose points are relatively similar for each year, and follow the same trends. "

You can tell by the different columns that it is more symmetric on both sides meaning that the mean and the median are roughly the same.
